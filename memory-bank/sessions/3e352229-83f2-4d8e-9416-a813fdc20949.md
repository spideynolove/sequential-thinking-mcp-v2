## Problem Statement
Modernize the sequential-thinking-mcp-v2 project based on insights from COMMENTs.md, focusing on: 1) Adding comprehensive testing infrastructure (currently 0% coverage), 2) Enhancing error handling for robustness, 3) Improving memory utilization, 4) Adding session synchronization across different locations, 5) General code quality improvements

## Success Criteria
A modernized, production-ready MCP server with comprehensive test coverage, robust error handling, improved memory efficiency, cross-session synchronization, and enhanced code quality while maintaining the existing 12-tool architecture and markdown-based storage system.

## Constraints
Maintain the simple 4-file architecture, preserve markdown-based storage, keep all 12 existing tools functional, ensure backward compatibility, and avoid adding complex dependencies like databases.

## Codebase Context
Sequential Thinking MCP v2 - a Model Context Protocol server providing structured reasoning and memory persistence through 12 tools, using pure markdown file storage in memory-bank/ directory.
