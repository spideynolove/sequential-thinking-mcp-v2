# Execute Enterprise PRP

Implement a feature using enterprise PRP with multi-team validation, shared pattern reuse, and knowledge contribution workflows.

## Enterprise PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Enterprise Execution Process

1. **Load Enterprise Context**
   - Read the specified Enterprise PRP file
   - Load shared knowledge base from materials/shared/
   - Import cross-project patterns from materials/projects/shared_knowledge/
   - Validate team access permissions and enterprise compliance

2. **Enterprise Pattern Analysis**
   - Scan materials/shared/patterns/ for reusable components
   - Check materials/shared/libraries/ for existing implementations
   - Review materials/documentation/architecture/ for system constraints
   - Analyze cross-project dependencies and impact

3. **ENTERPRISE ULTRATHINK**
   - Create comprehensive implementation plan using TodoWrite
   - Identify shared pattern reuse opportunities
   - Plan cross-team collaboration touchpoints
   - Design knowledge contribution workflow
   - Validate enterprise compliance requirements

4. **Execute with Enterprise Validation**
   - Implement using shared patterns first
   - Follow enterprise coding standards from materials/shared/standards/
   - Include team review checkpoints
   - Document new patterns for shared repository

5. **Enterprise Validation Gates**
   - Run enterprise compliance checks
   - Execute cross-project impact analysis
   - Perform team review validation
   - Validate shared pattern integration

6. **Knowledge Contribution**
   - Extract reusable patterns for materials/shared/patterns/
   - Update integration guides in materials/documentation/
   - Contribute validated PRPs to materials/PRPs/validated/
   - Update cross-project knowledge base

## Enterprise Validation Commands

### Compliance and Standards
```bash
# Enterprise compliance validation
python materials/shared/standards/compliance_check.py

# Coding standards validation
ruff check --config materials/shared/standards/.ruff.toml

# Enterprise security scan
python materials/shared/standards/security_validator.py
```

### Cross-Project Impact
```bash
# Impact analysis on other teams
python materials/shared/patterns/impact_analyzer.py

# Dependency validation
python materials/shared/libraries/dependency_checker.py

# Integration testing
python materials/documentation/integration_guides/integration_tester.py
```

### Pattern Contribution
```bash
# Pattern extraction and validation
python materials/shared/patterns/pattern_extractor.py

# Knowledge base update
python materials/projects/shared_knowledge/knowledge_updater.py

# Documentation generation
python materials/documentation/doc_generator.py
```

## Enterprise Completion Checklist

### Implementation Quality
- [ ] Shared patterns reused where applicable
- [ ] Enterprise coding standards followed
- [ ] Cross-team dependencies documented
- [ ] Integration guides updated

### Validation and Compliance
- [ ] Enterprise compliance checks passed
- [ ] Cross-project impact assessed
- [ ] Team review completed and approved
- [ ] Security validation passed

### Knowledge Contribution
- [ ] New patterns extracted to materials/shared/patterns/
- [ ] Integration guides updated in materials/documentation/
- [ ] PRP validated and moved to materials/PRPs/validated/
- [ ] Cross-project knowledge base updated

### Team Collaboration
- [ ] Team notifications sent for shared component changes
- [ ] Knowledge transfer sessions scheduled if needed
- [ ] Pattern contribution documented for other teams
- [ ] Enterprise architecture team notified of decisions

## Error Handling and Rollback

If enterprise validation fails:
1. Check materials/documentation/troubleshooting/ for known issues
2. Consult materials/shared/patterns/ for alternative approaches
3. Engage enterprise architecture team if needed
4. Document resolution in materials/documentation/troubleshooting/

## Post-Implementation

1. **Pattern Contribution Review**
   - Schedule pattern review with enterprise architecture team
   - Update materials/shared/patterns/ with validated patterns
   - Contribute integration examples to materials/examples/

2. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Update team documentation in materials/projects/{team-name}/
   - Schedule knowledge sharing session with other teams
   - Update enterprise best practices if applicable

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Collect feedback on pattern effectiveness
   - Update PRP templates based on implementation learnings
   - Contribute improvements to enterprise development process

Note: Enterprise execution requires collaboration, compliance, and contribution to shared knowledge base for maximum organizational benefit.
